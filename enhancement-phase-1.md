**🎉 Phase 2 COMPLETED (2024-06-18):**
- ✅ Backend authentication module fully refactored and modularized
- ✅ User model and DB updated with reset/verification fields
- ✅ Centralized error handling and security middleware implemented
- ✅ Frontend authentication module completed (signup, login, forgot password, reset password)
- ✅ AuthContext updated with all authentication flows
- ✅ Dashboard sidebar made collapsible with hover effects and active state highlighting
- ✅ Back buttons added to all module pages (Team, Blog, Portfolio, Users)
- ✅ Toast service created for user feedback
- ✅ All routes secured with proper authentication and authorization
- ✅ Security headers (helmet) and CORS configured
- ✅ Input validation implemented on all endpoints
- ✅ Production-ready error handling and logging

**📊 Final Status: All Phase 2 objectives completed successfully!**

You are now entering **Phase 2** of the admin portal project. The MVP is already complete and functional with working CRUD operations for modules like Team, Blog, Portfolio, and Users.

Your task is to **refactor, enhance, and modularize** both backend and frontend codebases **without breaking any existing functionality**. Apply scalable architecture and folder structure standards used by top engineering teams at companies like Google or Microsoft.

## ✅ Phase 2 Objectives

- ⚙️ No regression: All previously working features **must remain functional** ✅
- 🏗️ Focus on best practices: optimized folder structure, reusable modular code, clean architecture ✅
- 🔐 Harden the authentication module ✅
- 🧭 Improve dashboard UX behavior and navigation ✅
- ✅ All code changes must be **structured, well-commented, and maintainable** ✅
- 🧪 Ensure 0 errors across both client and server side ✅

## 📦 Frontend (React.js + Material UI) Enhancements

- [x] **Authentication Module Refactor**
  - [x] Create a clean, isolated auth module structure (`/auth`)
  - [x] Include Signup, Login, and Forgot Password features
  - [x] Add complete form validation (e.g., email format, required fields)
  - [x] Use proper naming conventions and folder separation (`/pages/auth`, `/services/auth`, etc.)
  - [x] Implement Forgot Password flow with email trigger and token validation
  - [x] On success, redirect to secured dashboard
  - [x] Show toast/snackbar messages for success/failure
  
- [x] **Dashboard Enhancements**
  - [x] Make sidebar **collapsible** (working toggle)
  - [x] Add **hover effects** and **active state highlight** on sidebar links
  - [x] Add **Back button icon** to the left of the "Add" button inside each module page
  - [x] Secure Dashboard and all modules using **route guards** (auth-based access)

- [x] **Code and Folder Structure Refactor**
  - [x] Modularize each module (Team, Blog, Portfolio, Users) with clear folder boundaries
  - [x] Refactor to a layered architecture: `components`, `pages`, `services`, `utils`, `hooks`, `layout`, `context`, etc.
  - [x] Use environment variables and config folders properly
  - [x] Ensure all code is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

## 🛠️ Backend (Node.js + Express + MySQL) Enhancements

- [x] **Authentication Module**
  - [x] Organize into clear structure: `routes/auth`, `controllers/auth`, `services/auth`, `middleware`
  - [x] Add signup, login, forgot password with secure token logic
  - [x] Email token flow: link to reset password (dummy email service for dev)
  - [x] Password hashing (bcrypt) and JWT-based token authentication
  - [x] Add central validation using `Joi`

- [x] **Code & Folder Refactor**
  - [x] Structure code with `routes`, `controllers`, `models`, `services`, `utils`, and `middleware`
  - [x] Ensure clean and scalable file organization
  - [x] Add centralized error handling (using `errorHandler.js`)
  - [x] Use `.env` for sensitive data; refactor all hardcoded values
  - [x] Refactor seeders if needed, but do not overwrite data

- [x] **Security**
  - [x] Secure all routes (except auth) using middleware (`verifyToken`)
  - [x] Sanitize inputs, validate data on all CRUD endpoints
  - [x] Add CORS configuration and security headers (helmet)

## 🔄 Phase 2 Rules

- ✅ Do NOT modify or delete any existing functionality unless stated
- ✅ Only enhance and refactor with 100% backward compatibility
- ✅ Add comments, types, and documentation wherever necessary
- ✅ Maintain production-ready coding discipline: no console logs, temporary files, or unused variables

---

## 📁 Output Expectations

- 🔒 Fully working authentication module ✅
- 🧱 Refactored folder structure (Google-style) ✅
- 🚀 Optimized code with clear separation of concerns ✅
- 📋 No console errors, warnings, or regressions ✅
- ✅ Backend and Frontend both 100% functional post-refactor ✅
