## üöÄ Enhancement Phase 4: Dynamic Website Integration via Admin Portal

### üë®‚Äçüíª Role
You are a **senior-level Cursor AI prompt engineer** tasked with connecting the Admin Portal to the public-facing website, ensuring all content (Blog, Portfolio, Team) is managed dynamically via RESTful API endpoints.

- [x] Remove authentication from GET endpoints for public data access
- [x] Ensure POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH remain protected for admin/auth users
- [x] Restart backend server to apply changes
- [x] Test all endpoints using Postman/cURL to confirm public access and correct data
- [x] Document all endpoints and integration steps
- [x] Confirm robust error handling and input validation for all endpoints
- [x] Ensure CORS and security headers are set for public API
- [x] Validate that all public GET endpoints return correct JSON data and images
